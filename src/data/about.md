# Intro

I am a PhD candidate at [University of Vienna](https://img.univie.ac.at/) where I research seismo-acoustics and Machine Learning. I also teach at the [Center for Neural Networks](msu.ai) for Science at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. I am particularly interested in projects that are on the overlap between Scientific Research and Machine Learning. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At the University of Vienna, I have learned how to maintain independent research, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with other academics, teach complicated things in an approachable manner, and build research instruments with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). 

# Travel / Geography

- I am originally from the suburbs of Moscow, Russia. I have since lived in Trondheim, Oslo, and Vienna.
- I've been to ~ 50 countries, many of which I would like to revisit.
