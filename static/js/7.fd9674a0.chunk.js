I also teach at the [Center for Neural Networks](msu.ai) for Science at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. I am particularly interested in projects that are on the overlap between Scientific Research and Machine Learning. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt the University of Vienna, I have learned how to maintain independent research, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with other academics, teach complicated things in an approachable manner, and build research instruments with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). \n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am originally from the suburbs of Moscow, Russia. I have since lived in Trondheim, Oslo, and Vienna.\n- I've been to ~ 50 countries, many of which I would like to revisit.",l=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(r.b,Object(i.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Artemii Novoselov",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(r.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(o.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
